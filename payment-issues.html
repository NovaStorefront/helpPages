        <p>If you're using a credit card, it's important to double-check that the billing address on your order matches 
            the one associated with your card.
            <br>
            <br> Don't worry â€“ this is a common mistake! Often, the error occurs when 
            there's a mismatch between the billing details.
            <br>
            <br>
            Give it another go by ensuring that the billing address you provide matches the one on file with your 
            credit card. If you're still encountering issues, just shoot a quick email to our friendly 
            customer service team at <a href="mailto:customerservice@novabrandprojection.com";>customerservice@novabrandprojection.com</a>.
             Include the last 4 digits of your credit card, and our awesome team will work their magic to provide you 
             with the specific error code from your bank.
