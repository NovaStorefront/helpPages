            <p>If you're using a credit card, it's important to double-check that the billing address on your order matches 
                the one associated with your card.
                <br>
                <br> Don't worry â€“ this is a common mistake! Often, the error occurs when 
                there's a mismatch between the billing details.
                <br>
                <br>
                Give it another go by ensuring that the billing address you provide matches the one on file with your 
                credit card. If you're still encountering issues, just shoot a quick email to our friendly 
                customer service team at <a href="mailto:customerservice@novabrandprojection.com";>customerservice@novabrandprojection.com</a>.
                 Include the last 4 digits of your credit card, and our awesome team will work their magic to provide you 
                 with the specific error code from your bank.
                 <br>
